# 🚚 Linehaul Capacity Planning & SLA Risk Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes linehaul logistics operations to identify:
- Capacity utilization issues across hubs
- Route-level delay risks
- SLA breach patterns
- High-risk operational routes

The goal is to help operations leadership take proactive decisions
for improving delivery reliability and capacity planning.

## 🧠 Key Business Questions Solved
1. Which hubs are overloaded or underutilized?
2. Which routes face frequent shipment delays?
3. Which routes breach SLA frequently?
4. Which routes are high operational risk?
5. What final dataset can power an executive dashboard?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Aggregations & CASE logic
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Business KPI Calculations

## 📊 Key Metrics Built
- Capacity Utilization %
- Delay %
- SLA Breach %
- Route Risk Category (High / Medium / Low)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `sql/` → All analysis queries
- `data/` → Sample datasets (hubs, routes, shipments)
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🎯 Final Output
A single **Executive Dashboard Dataset** that can directly feed into:
- Power BI
- Excel Dashboards
- Operations Review Reports
